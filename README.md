# Microdrone

(Check out the Quadmode branch...takes it from Zero to Hero)

This is the code for the microdrone. It is a very simple 8 oscillator audio drone.

I describe its conception here. I doni't see this as a "thing" more of a demonstration and
development of an idea.

To be honest with you I am not actually sure what this thing is for. As a drone oscillator that can be sent on to other pedals and effects 
maybe it has some value. But it doesn't have a midi or control voltage interface or even a stylus so its not even in stylophone territory..  
It does however do one thing really well and this is probably the only reason I bothered with it; it varies its volume by using precise out i
of phase oscillators. This gave me a reason to finish soldering it together and put it in a case so I could at least explain it..
